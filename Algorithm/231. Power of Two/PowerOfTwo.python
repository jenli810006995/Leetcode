/* Logic: Power of 2 means only one bit of n is 1. We use bitwise to test if a value is a power of 2. If (n&(n-1)) == 0 means it is not the power of 2 */

/* Solution */

class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n:int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        elif (n & (n-1))==0:
            return True
